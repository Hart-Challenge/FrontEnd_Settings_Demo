## This is my challenge submission.

Here is how it looks on a 1920x1080 screen.

## Images can be previewed without uploading to back end.

Instant confidence boost given to users upon image selection via compliment.

## Non-intrusive password change input boxes.

Only shows if 'Change my Password' is clicked.

## I didn't forget about mobile experience!

Mobile users are people too, so I decided to create something special, just for them!

I call it, THE OMNITAB ®.

## The OMNITAB® in action.

Because mobile users are people too.

# Tested on Chromium 48 and Safari 9.1.1

Based on previous experience, it's safe to say that there will be some challenges ahead
when I test this on IE11.
